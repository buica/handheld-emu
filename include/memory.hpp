//Memory class will act as our emulator's memory bus and
// bus controller, handling memory access and communication between the CPU and PPU.
//

//To-do:
// - implement memory mapping
// - implement basic memory operations
// LATER: we should probably create a SERIAL class to optimize serial communication to/from peripherals.
